Name: Claw Kitchen

Player has to fulfill food orders. 
The orders appear on right side of screen as white bubbles with the ingredient/amount needed shown. 
Player collects ingredients from various claw machines in the kitchen each with its own challenge to it.
Once player has ingredient they can click on the burner to place food.
Player can also collect upgrades for new kitchen such as more burners to cook food so they can keep up with order demand.
The orders frequency increases over time while the time to prepare is shortened. 
It gets crazy till you cant keep up with the orders.

-I really like the way the farm gets upgraded and lets the runs get crazy with how much you can produce, 
also needing to do time management between gathering and cooking.
